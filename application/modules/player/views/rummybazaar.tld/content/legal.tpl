<h3><strong>Is Rummy a Game of Skill?</strong></h3>
<p>Yes! Online Rummy games offered on this website are games of skill. Almost all laws in relation to gambling in force in the states of India provide that they shall not restrict games of skill. Under these laws, gambling relates to wagering and betting on games of chance and uncertain events where chance is a dominant factor.
<p>The Supreme Court and several state high courts have discussed the matter and come up with several rulings. The gist of such rulings can be summed up by one ruling from the high court. </p>
<p><i>"Rummy, on the other hand, requires certain amount of skill because the fall of the cards has to be memorised and the building up of Rummy requires considerable skill in holding and discarding cards. We cannot, therefore, say that the game of Rummy is a game of entire chance. It is mainly and preponderantly a game of skill. The chance in Rummy is of the same character as the chance in a deal at a game of bridge."</i></p>
<p class="bottom">A Supreme Court ruling of 1967 (State of Andhra Pradesh vs K. Satyanarayan) states that Rummy cannot be called a "game of entire chance" and "is mainly and preponderantly a game of skill". </p>
