<b>Keno:</b>
<p>
For many people, how to play keno is a mystery; but this popular game couldn't be easier to learn. When you first start a game of keno, you will immediately be reminded of a lottery card (<b>Big Heart</b>). In fact the game used to be called Chinese Lottery. Learning how to play keno is just about as easy as figuring out how to fill in a lottery ticket, but in a casino, there's an endless supply of "cards" to play, and you can play for as long as you like. With our casino games suite, you can play for free for as long as it takes you to feel comfortable playing. When you first open up our game of keno, you'll see a large heart with the numbers 1 to 90 listed in order starting at the top left and ending at the bottom, going row by row. You'll also see a few buttons below the board that you may use to customize the game to your playing style. The button on the far left is used to select the amount you want to bet, and you can increase or decrease the amount by using the left or right buttons on either side of the money amount. The clear button to the right is used to clear all the numbers you've picked; either after playing a card, or because you thought better of the sequence of numbers you chose and want to start over. If you just want to change one or a few of the numbers, you may "unselect" them by clicking on them a second time, thereby giving you the opportunity to pick a new number.

The <b>DRAW</b> button in the middle gives you the option of playing a keno game. When you're learning how to play keno, you first chose from 1 to 15 numbers from anywhere on the board by clicking on the number with your mouse. This is like having a bingo card with some sequence of numbers on it, and waiting to see if they come up when the big drum full of balls is spinning, only with keno, you choose the sequence of numbers. In keno, there is cupid shooting arrows at the numbered hearts. A total of 20 arrows are "drawn", and if your choices match 1 or more of them (depending on the choice), you've won! In our computer version of this game, the 20 numbers are chosen using a random number generator, and are as random as you can get.

As you learn how to play keno using our computer version of the game, you'll get the hang of it in no time. As you select the numbers you want to use, the payout table will tell you what you'll win when you get a particular number of "hits". That's when the number or numbers you selected are matched. Basically speaking, the more numbers you select, the higher the top payout is. If you pick 15 numbers, you can win 10,000 times your bet! The chances may be small, but that's winning big!
